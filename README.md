The Labtools Unified Library
============================

Arduino based firmware libraries and examples for the hardware that is curated by labtools at AU's ChomskyLab.

Why?
====

The leaning goals of the physical design / pdp courses at the beginning of the IT bachelors course do not encompass learning interfacing with sensors / actuators, therefore we have tried to do as much of the work as possible for you in this regard, so as to enable a quick start, so you can focus on exploring design ideas without feeling restrained by the technological aspect of things.

Questions and comments are welcomed, either here or on labtools@cs.au.dk.

Howto
=====

Subfolders contain readme files with fritzing diagrams where appropriate. 

All subfolders contain example code.

Some examples require downloading external "libraries" to your arduino development environment, this is explained if it is the case.
